THIS PROJECT WAS A SCHOOL PROJECT OF MINE WHICH I MADE WITH THE HELP OF A FRIEND. 
OUR GOAL WAS TO MAKE A PROGRAM WHICH TOOK IN THE INPUTS OF THE PRICE A SECOND HAND CAR WAS SOLD FOR AND CREATE A DATABASE IN MYSQL WITH THAT.
THEN USING THE DATABASE WE CREATED WE WOULD RUN A REGRESSION ON IT TO FIND OUT HOW THE PRICE OF THE CAR WAS AFFECTED BY THE OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CAR.
USING THIS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PREDICT THE PRICE OF A SECOND HAND CAR JST WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS COMPONENTS.
